This is the code sample from following the youtube tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8

I'm using this to brush up on React with the new format.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
